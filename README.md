# Blockchain-Lottery-System-Mini-project
I've made a lottery system which is mini project using Solidity.
The rules of the lottery system are:
i) There will be a manager who will have every access
ii) There must be minimum of 3 participant
iii) Every participant must buy minimum of 2 ethers
iv) Participant can buy more than one lottery but each lottery will contain 2 ethers.
I've also tested it with fake ethers.
